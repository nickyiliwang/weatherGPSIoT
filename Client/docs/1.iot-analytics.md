# AWS IoT Analytics
Fully-managed service that runs and operationalize sophisticated analytics on massive volumes of IoT data.

Flow:
Collect => Process (pipeline) => Store => Analyze => Build

High-level overview:
Channel => pipeline => data store => data sets

## Creating a rule in IoT core
Rules define where to get the data and what to do with it.
ie. start a step function state machine execution from outTopic topic
*Newest: Send a message to a downstream HTTPS endpoint

1. Name the rule prefix
2. Rule query statement: subscribing to a topic name (ie. outTopic)
3. Actions: Send a message to IoT Analytics
4. Quick create will create channel, pipeline, data store and SQL data set in IoT Analytics and role (we can manually do this)
5. *Activate the rule

With this rule in place we can already send IoT sensor data and process it into a dataset

The pipeline we are working with pulls data from "outTopic"

## ESP32 Sketch mock temp-humid
[This sketch sends mock data to our IoT-Analytics pipeline to compile into a dataset](../Archive/temp-humid.cpp)

1, Data format(note the array): 
```
[{ temperature: 12, humidity: 12 }]
```
2. We are taking this data and transforming it with an lambda function that adds "serverSideTimeStamp"

## Data transformation with Lambda function 
1. After we get our dataset from Analytics, we can create a lambda function called: node_iot_esp32 

2. *important iot analytics starts without permission to invoke lambda functions; to add permission in the cli:
```
aws lambda add-permission --function-name <your function name>
--action lambda:InvokeFunction --statement-id iotanalytics
--principal iotanalytics.amazonaws.com --profile <your aws profile>
```

## Dataset content delivery rules
Using Dataset content delivery rules in aws iot analytics to save data in csv format to s3:
```
dataset/mydataset/!{iotanalytics:scheduleTime}/!{iotanalytics:versionId}.csv
```

To make the buckets public, attach this bucket policy:
```
{
  "Version" : "2012-10-17", "Statement" : [ {
    "Sid" : "PublicRead",
    "Effect" : "Allow",
    "Principal" : "*",
    "Action" : "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource" :
        "arn:aws:s3:::iot-analytics-temperature-humidity-esp32-nickyiliwang/*"
  } ]
}
```
To avoid cors errors:
```
[{
  "AllowedHeaders" : ["Authorization"],
  "AllowedMethods" : ["GET"],
  "AllowedOrigins" : ["*"],
  "ExposeHeaders" : [],
  "MaxAgeSeconds" : 3000
}] 
```
