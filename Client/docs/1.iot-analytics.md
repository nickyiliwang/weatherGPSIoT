# AWS IoT Analytics
Fully-managed service that runs and operationalize sophisticated analytics on massive volumes of IoT data.

Flow:
Collect => Process (pipeline) => Store => Analyze => Build

High-level overview:
Channel => pipeline => data store => data sets

## Creating a rule in IoT core
Rules define where to get the data and what to do with it.
ie. start a step function state machine execution from outTopic topic
*Newest: Send a message to a downstream HTTPS endpoint

1. Name the rule prefix
2. Rule query statement: subscribing to a topic name (ie. outTopic)
3. Actions: Send a message to IoT Analytics
4. Quick create will create channel, pipeline, data store and SQL data set in IoT Analytics and role (we can manually do this)
5. *Activate the rule

With this rule in place we can already send IoT sensor data and process it into a dataset
