2. New analysis new data set

## Sagemaker
How:
1. Create a notebook and give a name and role name

## Using S3 as an Data-lake
Why:
1. QuickSight and SageMaker has access to S3 APIs
2. Data format flexibility
3. Access to Boto3 through API Gateway to Lambda, normally with Jupyter notebook
4. Serverless Service chaining is cheaper than using an instance 

How:
1. AWS IoTAnalytics/Dataset page => your generated created dataset from data store in your pipeline
2. Select and Edit Data set content delivery rules
3. Deliver result to S3
4. Create a new bucket from here or S3 page
5. Select the bucket and Create or Select a Role to grant permissions
